 * Interface intended to have a specific implementation associated to a {@link CloudConnectionService} and with

 * subscription and notification process, for each application running in the framework.
 * When an application wants to receive a message from the cloud, it has to take a {@link CloudSubscriber} instance and
 * register itself as a {@link CloudSubscriberListener}, in order to be notified when a message is received by the
 * subscriber.
