 * {@link CloudSubscriber} running in the gateway.
 *
 * Each cloud provider should provide its own {@link CloudConnectionService} implementation in order to best fit the
 * specific requirements.

 * Applications should not use directly this API but, instead, use the {@link CloudPublisher} and the
